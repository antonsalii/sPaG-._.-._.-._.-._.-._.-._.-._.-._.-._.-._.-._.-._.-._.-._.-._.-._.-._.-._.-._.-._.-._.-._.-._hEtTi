# Leap Year Checker

This repository contains a one-liner Python script that determines whether a given year is a leap year (Task 1).

## Functionality

The program accepts a year as input in the `yyyy` format and returns whether the year is a leap year or not, based on the following criteria:
- A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4.
- However, if the year is divisible by 100, it is **not** a leap year unless it is also divisible by 400.

You can see an example of the program's work in the image `leap_year_checker_example.png`.

### Example

```
Input: 2024
Output: Leap Year

Input: 2025
Output: Not a Leap Year
```

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.12 or higher installed.

## Usage


To run the code, use the following command in your terminal:

```shell
python the_whole_code_for_this_program_could_be_literally_like_print_lp_q_Leap_year_q_if_year_per_4_eq_eq_0_and_lp_year_per_100_exm_eq_0_or_year_per_400_eq_eq_0_rp_else_q_Not_a_leap_year_q_rp.py
```
